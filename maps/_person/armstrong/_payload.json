There were epidemics of tuberculosis. Child labor and 12-hour work days were used to ensure economic output. The average life expectancy had barely budged in a thousand years. If you reached senior-citizen status you beat the odds; to have all your children reach adulthood was rare. Waterborne diseases like typhoid fever and cholera were scourges around the globe.

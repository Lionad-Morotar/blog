That’s a rigorous deduction based on the laws of nature; on the conservation of mass, energy, and momentum; on Newtonian mechanics, Ohm’s law, Charles’s law, and all those kinds of relationships.

There were epidemics of tuberculosis. Child labor and 12-hour work days were used to ensure economic output. The average life expectancy had barely budged in a thousand years. If you reached senior-citizen status you beat the odds; to have all your children reach adulthood was rare. Waterborne diseases like typhoid fever and cholera were scourges around the globe.

Electrification changed the country’s economic development and gave rural populations the same opportunities and amenities as people in the cities. Electricity provides the power for small appliances in the home, for computers in control rooms that route power and telecommunications, and for the machinery that produces capital goods and consumer products. If anything shines as an example of how engineering has changed the world during the twentieth century, it is clearly the power that we use in our homes and businesses.",{"type":405,"tag":413,"props":960,"children":961},{},[962],{"type":410,"value":963},"排名前 20 中的大多数成就脱离电力没有办法实现。电力工程改变了国家的经济发展水平，使乡村人口获得了和城市居民一样的机会和设施。电力为家庭中的小型电器提供能源，给控制室的电脑、路由器、通讯设备以及为生产资本货物和消费品的机器提供能源。如果有什么东西能作为在二十世纪改变了世界的例子，显然，那就是家庭和企业中使用的电力。",{"type":405,"tag":413,"props":965,"children":966},{},[967],{"type":410,"value":968},"So, there you have it, the top 20. My descriptions have been sometimes trite, and it’s likely that I missed some of the most important societal contributions from the nominees. And, without question, I did not even mention the work from those nominations that did not make the top 20 list, yet in many cases were of enormous importance to certain sectors of society or certain parts of the world. And in all honestly, I am guilty of a bit of subterfuge. Certainly the nominations were worthy, certainly the committee was honest and diligent in evaluating those candidations. And certainly you have been given their well-reasoned conclusions. The subterfuge is that my purpose was not to promote the competitive nature of the event, or to congratulate the winner, or to convince you that electrification was the most important technical activity of this past century.

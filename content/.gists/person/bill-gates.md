“In my lifetime, I’ve seen two demonstrations of technology that struck me as revolutionary.”

两个最具革命意义的技术展示，一个是 1980 年，Charles Simonyi 向比尔盖茨展示了 GUI，而是 2022 年，OpenAI 团队仅花了 3 个月的时间便完成了他对团队设置的，训练 GPT 以完成 59/60 的选择题通过先修生物考试测试的任务。

“Once it had aced the test, we asked it a non-scientific question: “What do you say to a father with a sick child?” It wrote a thoughtful answer that was probably better than most of us in the room would have given.”

如今就这个问题向 ChatGPT 提问，能得到以下回答：

> As an AI language model, I can offer words of support and empathy to a father with a sick child. I am sorry to hear that your child is unwell, and I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you as a parent. 
> It is important to prioritize your child's health and seek medical attention promptly. You may want to speak with your child's doctor or healthcare provider to discuss treatment options and any concerns you may have. Remember to take care of yourself as well, as caring for a sick child can be emotionally and physically exhausting.
> It is also important to remember that you are not alone. You may want to reach out to friends, family, or support groups for help and comfort during this challenging time. Remember that with proper medical care and support, many illnesses can be managed or treated successfully.

“**I’ve been thinking a lot about how AI can reduce some of the world’s worst inequities.**”

让 AI 减少而不是加剧不平等是 gates 的个人工作的一个重点，他认为在改善教育和较少气候变化带来的影响是两个机会，“The injustice of climate change is that the people who are suffering the most—the world’s poorest—are also the ones who did the least to contribute to the problem.”。

“AGI doesn’t exist yet—there is a robust debate going on in the computing industry about how to create it, and whether it can even be created at all.”

AIGC 和 AGI 就差了一个字母。尽管 AGI 仍饱受争议，但复杂的 AI 已经出现，同时它在快速的迭代升级。

“require decision-making but not the ability to learn continuously.”

许多公司用案例来培训人们如何处理各类工作情况，比如数字销售、文件处理人员等，这些工作需要决策，但不是持续学习能力。“ soon these data sets will also be used to train the AIs that will empower people to do this work more efficiently.”，也许这些简单的决策可以直接交由 AI 完成。

“Eventually your main way of controlling a computer will no longer be pointing and clicking or tapping on menus and dialogue boxes.”

全新人机交互时代的开端。嗯，前端的第二春。

至于 GPT 是不是真正能“理解”语言和沟通，我认为没那么重要。

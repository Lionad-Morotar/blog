## 评价

Herb Caudill 提到 Zapier（同样的，以及 q 相似的软件）在真实应用中可能缺乏可靠性。

> Zapier lets you link one app to another via their public APIs: A trigger in one app results in an action in another. In some simple cases it works great. But the trigger/action model can be clumsy and brittle in practice. Getting two systems to maintain the same dataset in sync is a real challenge. Sometimes it just fails silently, and you don’t realize it until you go to look at your home-made dashboard and it doesn’t have any data for the last couple of months.

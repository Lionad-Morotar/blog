My name is tian yao from hua zhong university of science and technology. ‍‍My talk today is metrics kv reducing right store and right amplification in lsmg based kv stores‍‍ with a metrics container in on the end. ‍‍This is a joint work of pink cup company, the university of texas at arlington and temple university. ‍‍I will give this talk in four parts. First, let me introduce the backgrounds and motivation. ‍‍L symmetry based akv store are widely deployed in riding tensive scenarios. ‍‍Popular kv stores such as level db cassandra and rocks db are built with l sm tree. ‍‍They usually run assistance with d ram and ssd storage is‍‍ elsam trees offer high ride throughput by batching right in memory and offer faster read and range quarries with lifetime compaction. ‍‍This figure present the structure of an l symmetry in the popular implementation, rocks db‍‍ rusty b is composed of ad ram component and an ssd component. ‍‍Alsome tree levels on ssd are exponentially increased from level zero to level six. ‍‍At the amplification factor of ten rights request, first inserting to memory tables in d ram, ‍‍then flush to ssd finally do level by level complexions. Overall, ‍‍the operations of rux db manly includes insert, flush and compassion of multiple levels‍‍ to better understand elm tree based the, kb store. ‍‍We evaluate rocks db by randomly writing an 80 gigabyte data set‍‍ and measure the random rights throughput in every 10 seconds. ‍‍From this figure, we first observe the challenge of right store. That is‍‍ application throughput periodically dropped to nearly zero. The troughs of system throughput indicate right stores, ‍‍the dramatic fluctuation of performance and long tail latencies‍‍ go against non sequel assistance, design goal of predictable and stable performance. ‍‍To figure out the reason of rice stores, we record the period of each flush and compaction‍‍ of different levels. Surprisingly, we find that the period of level zero to level one compaction‍‍ mattress right stall approximately. ‍‍Here we can see that each red line represent a level zero to level one compaction. ‍‍Its lands along x axis represent the latency of the compaction. ‍‍The right y axis shows the amount of data processed in each complexion. So‍‍ it reaches 3.1 gigabyte, on average. ‍‍Now we elaborate the level zero to level one compaction to explain why it involves so much compaction data‍‍ to come back a level zero to level one compaction. First, we pick a victim assets table in level zero. ‍‍Second, over left ss tables in level one are picked. Third, ‍‍since ss tables in level zero, are ov er la pp ed to each other. ‍‍We go back to level zero and pick more ss tables within the compaction key range. Fourth, we've‍‍ go to level one and find if there are any other ov er la pp ed as as tables and picks day and pick it. ‍‍Now we get all the compaction data or the compaction data, ‍‍or read into the memory, merge and salt, then right back to level one. ‍‍As we go back and forth between level zero and level one. ‍‍Almost ss all assets tables in both level, joins the level zero to level one compaction in the end. ‍‍The larger amount of compaction data leads to heavy read, ‍‍merge, right? Which takes up cp u cycles and ssd bandwidth, ‍‍thus blocking foreground request and making level zero to level one compaction, the primary cost of right stores‍‍ from the same test. We observe the second challenge. ‍‍As the green line shows, system throughput degrade with the increase of data sets, size. ‍‍The growing data set increases the depths of an l symmetry, so that brings more compaction and thus higher right amplification. ‍‍As we know, l symmetry based kv stores have long been criticized for their high right amplification, ‍‍due to level by level complexions with the amplification factor of adjacent levels of ten, by default. ‍‍Right? Amplification increases with a number of levels. ‍‍That is right, amplification accords to af times n where n is the number of levels. ‍‍Emerging non voluntal memory technologies has the property of fast success by adjustable and persistency. ‍‍It provides us a potential solution to adjust the both challenges. ‍‍Na va sm from abc 18 adopts only m to store large mutable memory tables. ‍‍From the right figure, we can see that now vs m improves random right throughput‍‍ compared to rocks. Db is about 1.7 times. ‍‍To some extent, it due reduce right amplification. ‍‍However, it significantly increases the size of on sorted level zero. ‍‍That makes level zero to level one. Compassion data reaches 15 gigabyte. ‍‍The larger amount of compassion data making the period of right store extended severely. Hence, we say‍‍ the state of art solution. ‍‍Now, sm is not sufficient to adjust the both two challenging issues. ‍‍From the above analysis, we conclude that‍‍ all to all level zero to level one, compaction is the main cause of red stock. ‍‍Rice stop brings unpredictable and unstable performance. ‍‍The increased depth of alexum tree is the main course of increased, right amplification. ‍‍Higher, right? Amplification brings decreased system performance, especially decreased random, right? Throughput, ‍‍motivated by these challenging issues. ‍‍We propose matrix kv‍‍ that aims to reducing right store and right amplification in l symmetry based kv stores by exploiting nvn‍‍ next, we will see the design of metrics, kv‍‍ this figure shows the overall architecture of matrix kv we add an nvm between d ram and ssd‍‍ as we can see from the right figure from the top to the button, they ran batches, right? ‍‍Nvm stores the top level of sm tree with our proposed metrics container. ‍‍Ssd stores the remaining levels of a flattened alison tree. ‍‍Matrix kv has four design strategies. First, the metrics container in nvn that stores‍‍ and manage the un. So rt, ed level zero. Second, the column compaction to reduce right stores. Third, ‍‍the flattened sm tree on ssd to reduce right amplification‍‍ and force the crossroad hint search to improve the red efficiency in nvn‍‍ in the following, I will introduce all the four design strategies, one by one. ‍‍First, let's see the metrics container manages the level zero of lsm three. ‍‍He consists of a receiver and a compactor. ‍‍For receiver, it receives flushed memory table from the ram and stores them row by row, ‍‍where each row is organized as a role table. As showing this figure, ‍‍an immutable memory table flashed from the rain is stored in the receiver as a row table. ‍‍Once the receiver is fully filled, in process, a it logically turns into a compactor. ‍‍Then‍‍ for competitor, it compacts data from level zero to level one column by column. ‍‍We call it column compaction like these. The nvm pages of a, column or freed after the column compaction. ‍‍Those 3 pages are returned to the free list and waiting for storing newly flashed data. ‍‍Here we show the row table structure. Row table consists of data and math data. ‍‍The data region stores serialized kv items from the immutable memory table. ‍‍The math data region is a sorted array. ‍‍Isury, my element maintains the key, the page number, the offsetting the page, ‍‍and a forward pointer for crossroad hint search. To locate akv item in this row table. ‍‍We just need binary search, the sorted array to forget the target key, ‍‍and then its value can be indexed with the page number and offset‍‍ with the metrics, container and road table. ‍‍Now we can do, ‍‍we can do the fine grand column compaction for level zero and level one. ‍‍The non ov, er la pp ed level one on ssd provide us assorted key space with multiple contiguous key ranges. ‍‍As showing this figure, the contiguous key range are 023, ‍‍325528, and so on. ‍‍Now I introduce the column compaction with an example. ‍‍Column compassion starts from the first key range in level one that is 0 to 3, then‍‍ multiple thread in the compactor or‍‍ multiple threats in the compactor searches, the keys within the key range, 0 to 3 like this. ‍‍If the amount of data is under the threshold of a compaction, the next key range 3 to 5 joins, ‍‍if the amount of data is still not enough, the next range 5 to 8 joins. ‍‍Finally, the compaction range is 0 to 8. ‍‍A logical column is formed with the data within the key range, 0 to 8. ‍‍And the column compaction merges the column and the first two ss tables in level one. ‍‍Then we do the next column compaction, arrange 8 to 30 and the next one‍‍ by processing level zero to level one, column, compassion, column by column. ‍‍Each compaction only merges a small key range that has very limited amount of data. Hence, ‍‍the column compaction can reduce right amplification, right? Stores due to all compaction. ‍‍Since right amplification, ecles to af times the number of lmc levels‍‍ matches kb tries to flatten the lcm tree to reduce right amplification. ‍‍So‍‍ what we do is keep the af on change while increasing the size of level zero and level one to reduce the n‍‍ due to column compassion, the size of level zero and level one does not affect the overhead‍‍ of level zero to level one. Compaction is always at a limited amount of data. ‍‍Since larger on salted level zero might decrease. ‍‍The red efficiency of metrics, kv we propose crossroad hint, search next. The process of crossroad hint, search. ‍‍To process the crossroad hint search, we need construct, crossroad hint with forward pointers. First. ‍‍For the key x in row table I is forward point indexes the key y in row table I minus one. ‍‍Why always the first key that no less than x‍‍ for example, here, 3 points, 235.267points to 8, and so on. ‍‍In this way, we can logically sort all keys in level zero. ‍‍Now, ‍‍if you want to search the key 12, ‍‍we first binary search, the row table three to get two adjacent keys. We wear. ‍‍The 12 might recite that is p 10 and 23 with the forward pointer of 10 and 23. ‍‍We can go to round table, too. ‍‍The key aid is added into our search region, because 12 is between 8 and 13. Then‍‍ we will go to row table one with the forward pointer of key 8 and 13. ‍‍Then we go to let row table zero finally, and find 12 in row table zero. ‍‍From this yellow region, we can see that crossroad hinge search‍‍ compares fewer keys that's reducing the search overhead compared to travels all of the keys and‍‍ come compares, all of the keys. ‍‍For the evaluation, we compare matrix kb with conventional rocks cb‍‍ which is the ssd based rock cb and the rock cb level zero in the end, ‍‍where it put level zero in nvm and run assistance with d ram mvmssd hierarchy, ‍‍then is the state of art. ‍‍Now, sm all the systems use‍‍ eight gigabyte opton, dcpmm‍‍ this figure shows the random right throughput with value sizes, ranging from 64 byte to 64 kilobyte. ‍‍Generally, matrix kv obtains the best random performance in all the different value sizes. ‍‍We just take the four kb value size as an example metrics. Kv out performs roxy b level zero and vn‍‍ by 3.6 times. And out performs not sm by 2.6 times respectfully. Next, ‍‍we will in explain this advantage of metrics. Kv comes from two reason. ‍‍The first is reduced the right store. The second is decreased, right amplification‍‍ by recording the throughput in every 10 seconds during the 80 gigabyt random note. ‍‍We see the fluctuation of system performance. Here, metrics kv is represented by red line. ‍‍This figure show that mattress kv is the fastest to load the same at gigabyte data set. ‍‍It has the most stable random right throughput, which means‍‍ we do reduce right stars with column compaction. ‍‍Okay? ‍‍In terms of tale latency, we can see that matrix kv obtains the shortest tale latency in all cases. ‍‍Taking the 99 person tale latency as an example. ‍‍Mattress kv is 27 times lower than rocks dbssd 5 times lower than not sm‍‍1.9 times lower than rocks db level zero nvn‍‍ here, we record each level zero to level one compaction to explain why matrix kv reduce right stores. ‍‍From this figure, we can see that for each level zero to level one compaction. Now, sm merges‍‍15 gigabyte data. Now sms rock cbssd merges 3.1 gigabyte data, ‍‍rock cb level zero nvn merges 4.9 gigabyte data. However, ‍‍metrics kv only merges 33 megabyte data, and it‍‍ due the column compaction for 467 times. So‍‍ the small but multiple time compaction reduce right store. ‍‍Here we show the right amplification of randomly loading 80 gigabyte data set. Test result show that‍‍ by flattering, the l symmetry matches kv reduces right amplification than others resistance. That's‍‍ that is 3.43 times here, right? Amplification is calculated by the ratio of‍‍ amount of data riden to ssd‍‍ to amount of data written by users. ‍‍In summary, conventional ssd based kv store are‍‍ has unpredicted has unpredictable performance due to write stores‍‍ And decrease the performance due to higher, right? Amplification. ‍‍Matches kv build an l symmetry based kv store for assistance with d RM, ndm and SSD storage. ‍‍With four design strategies, metrics, KB reduces right store and improves right throughput.
